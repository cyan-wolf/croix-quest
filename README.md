### Story

The Kingdom of _______ was once ruled by a monarchy, a corrupt one. Day after day the people grew tired of the corruption and chose to lead an uprising. The people were successful in making the monarchy give up its power. Thus forming a government of their own.

Many years later, a new leader was being decided upon and the person who was chosen was Emmy. MC (the player) works as a royal guard in charge of protecting the monarchy (figurehead). The night before Emmy’s inauguration, MC sees Queen Croix (figurehead) acting very suspicious. MC followed her and witnessed a meeting between her and 4 other guards. They were planning to ruin the inauguration tomorrow.

While trying to retreat, MC made a small noise that was caught on by everyone. They all quickly attacked him. After losing (Intentional Game Design) to the Queen and her soldiers, she would slowly approach and tell the MC how no one will stop her from executing her plans. Not even him. She conjured a curse that stripped the MC from his humanity and left him with an inhuman body. Now that he was weakened she was going to deal the final blow until the MC, in a last ditch effort, broke the balcony they were on and fell towards the river. The Queen would command her 4 soldiers to take the Spirit Animals away.

After waking up in a forest near the kingdom, the MC would travel undetected to the inauguration. Grabbing a piece of cloth from a cart, he would cover himself and head to the town centre. There he would spot some news posted on the village board. To his dismay, the queen had succeeded at her plan. She had framed the ruining of the inauguration on both the MC and Emmy. While soaking in the information, the MC spots Emmy in the crowd wearing a very bad disguise. After interacting and introducing each other, they would both decide to escape together.

In this kingdom, the inauguration ceremony involves the 4 spirit animals that bless the continent. After recalling what he saw the night before his confrontation, the MC and Emmy would decide to look for these spirits so they can clear their names.

After gathering information from an old friend of Emmy, they deduce that each spirit is being kept at each of the 4 dungeons in the continent. Each of them being guarded by the Queen’s knights (Bosses). 

After many trials and tribulations, you would be able to gather all the spirit animals and confront the queen. The queen, filled with rage, activated her necklace. This necklace caused the spirit animals to be absorbed into the amulet. Now the queen, possessing all the four powers, attacks the MC and Emmy. After defeating the queen and destroying the amulet, the MC would look at a broken mirror and still see his inhuman body. Clutching at his heart he came to terms with himself about the curse, and chose to embrace it as the new him.

The queen would be sent to jail and the inauguration ceremony would be redone. After the ceremony an afterparty was held where all the people Emmy and MC met along the way attended and ate with them. END
